    "Description": "First of all. I just downloaded the source and do not know if this issue has been up here before. But anyhow. Here I go:\n \nHow to reproduce:\n \nIm running XP SP2 - classic mode...\n \n1) I downloaded version 6125 of the source code.\n2) Start the Demo sample.\n3) Check the \"Enable custom borders\" checkbox.\n4) Minimize the Demo window\n5) Restore the Demo window\n \nResult:\nAfter restoring the window, it's height has increased (compared to when it was minimized).\n \nExcpected behaviour:\nThe window should have the same size after it has been restored as it had before being minimized.\n \nNotes:\nThe same behaviour exists when the following is done:\n1) \"Show desktop\" (Win+D or Win+M) \n2) Restore the Demo window. \n \nI now that the same windows messages are not sent in this case compared to the above, but it should behave the same way.",
