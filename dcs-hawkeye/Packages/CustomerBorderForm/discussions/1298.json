Thank you!<br /><br />So I've took it a bit further. First, I've split the project into several sub-projects. It's based on the structure you've created. The core classes are in the Lizard projects. For those who want to use the editor it's in the LizardEditor project. Both of them are now class libraries. <br /><br />The samples are now separate windows applications each. This is makes it much easier to test just by changing the startup projects. <br /><br />I also changed few class names. LizardForm (former CustomBorderForm) to SkinnedForm and FormWitnNonClientArea to NonClientBaseForm. <br /><br />Besides this I also moved few files here and there but I hope you will agree with these changes.<br /><br />Now let me know on your progress with custom caption buttons. I see that you are almost done in the core classes but currently the FormSkinEditor doesn't work. Are you working on this or I should take care of this? <br /><br />Also you've made changes to the skin format so the older skins won't work now. I think we should provide automatic conversion for older skins. I've already added the schemaVersion attribute in the skin file specifically to support this. <br />",

I would like to say that<br />the FormEditor is already working, but it remain a few work.<br /><br />Also, because of theses changes I have change the structure of the \"fsl\" files to be able to support<br />custom buttons.<br /><br />If you can add the project files today I expect to finish this development today.<br /><br />Thanks<br />",
