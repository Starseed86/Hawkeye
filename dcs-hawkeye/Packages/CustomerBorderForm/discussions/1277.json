We were taking a look at it today and noticed that the frame doesn't render correctly the first time (and really doesn't render at all.  It's not until the window is repainted by dragging a window over it, or by dragging the window off the screen, that it successfully paints itself.  Has anyone else seen this issue before?  Any insight would be appreciated!<br /><br />Many thanks,<br /><br />    Taylor<br />",

Although I will be buying a new home computer this month so it might change. In general we need to do better testing on other platforms. I already know there are some problems when you run it through Terminal Services or on a Virtual Machine. And there is already and issue entered for Vista. But first we need to check if it works fine on all flavors of WinXP and Win2003. I don't even know if it would work on Win2K.<br /><br />So it would be great if any of you can confirm if it works or not on any platform other then 32-bit Windows XP. <br /><br />I've entered work item <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/CustomerBorderForm/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=2983\">Test the project on different platforms</a> to track this so you can post your comments there.<br />",
