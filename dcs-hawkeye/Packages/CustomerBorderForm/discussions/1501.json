If someone is interested I am accepting bids  for these to be addressed very soon and undoubtedly included in the public project. <br />Here are some items:<br /><br />1. Ugly native title bar buttons show when pressing on custom buttons<br />2. The form can't be automatically resized below certain width, i.e, a call to this.Width = 20; will set the width to something over 100 even though you can decrease the size with the mouse.<br /><br />3. There's a problem displaying icons when a vertical bar remains on mouse up. Will provide details.<br /><br />5. Implement docking to the desktop<br /><br />6. The window crashes when resized to 0 width.<br /><br />7. Minor: Rich forms don't refresh properly on resize, get holes in the background, however slapping a bacckground panel helps. <br /><br /><br />",
