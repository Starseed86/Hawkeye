I've just added the missing files and I hope you won't get many conflicts.<br /><br />Second, I notice that you started renaming the xml element in fsl files. Please note that yesterday I've added an update script to automate upgrading from earlier versions. So I would appreciate if you consult such changes first with me or at lest let me know what you are going to do. <br /><br />Szymon<br />",
