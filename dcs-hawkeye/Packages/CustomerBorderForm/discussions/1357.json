By default we use \"images\" that are<br />defined in the SkinsEditor. We should also be able to have a custom renderer that \"draw\" the window<br />and the button.<br /><br />We can even add a specific \"rendering language\" or use the XAML etc...<br /><br />It is just an idea <br /><br />Regards<br />",
