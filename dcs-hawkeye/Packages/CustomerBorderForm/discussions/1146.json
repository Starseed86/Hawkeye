So until we have a clear idea what we want to achieve I don't see any value in merging these two libraries.<br /><br />I don't understand where you might have problems by using these two libraries separetly in a single project. The only issue I imagine is that we don't ship any skin that would match the look-and-feel Ascend.net has, but we do ship you tools so it's up to you to create one you like. <br />",
