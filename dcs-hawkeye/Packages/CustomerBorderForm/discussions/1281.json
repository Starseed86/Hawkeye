At least thats why we have the source control so we can always rollback anything that we don't like ;-)<br /><br />However few notes here:<br />1) We haven't yet decided on the library name. The name 'Lizard' is pretty cool but there are also some voices against it.<br />2) The same is for the project structure. I would review your changes during the weekend and let you know I any bothers me (or just adjust to my taste). <br />3) I would prefer if we follow a rule of one commit concerning a single thing. So if you are doing a refactoring then please don't commit it together with any bug fixes. <br />4) At the same time to keep track of things if you work on anything first please enter it to a issue tracker. This includes refactoring and project restructuring. This way others will know that some one is already working on this. <br /><br />But I like a lot that finally someone else is working on the code and please continue what you started. I will talk to you over the weekend. <br /><br />Szymon<br />",

I do not decide any name, and if you want I will change it in 10 minutes, it is easy to do.<br /><br />For the reminder, I will let you review my changes and wait for your comments.<br /><br />Tomorrow I will work on the \"Custom Caption\"... in fact I have already do 50% of the work in local.<br /><br />I will check it in tomorrow and attach a work item then ?<br /><br />Is it right like this ?<br /><br />thanks for all<br />",
