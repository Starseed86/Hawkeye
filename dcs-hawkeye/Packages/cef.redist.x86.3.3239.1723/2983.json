So if you have access to computer running such please report it works or not. \n \nIf you find any bugs please enter them as comments here or as new work items with details on the platform you use.",

This dll isn't present on all versions of Windows, and didn't appear to be present on Win2k.  We fixed it by putting a Windows version check around the call to UXTheme.  If anyone else has a more elegant solution I'd love to hear it too.",
