    "Description": "Love your work, btw. Thanks for giving to the community. I did run into a pretty major bug, however. The form isn't repainting very consistently so when I get a few controls on a form I'm getting a lot of visual echos and have to resize or force paints to see results of user clicks on various controls. I can give you a sample if you need. I know this is in alpha phase but hoping you can resolve soon. Thanks :)",
