    "Description": "We had an issue today with Win2K that I thought I would tell folks about.  Right now the Custom Border Form library P/Invokes to uxtheme.dll.  This dll isn't present on all versions of Windows, and didn't appear to be present on Win2k.  We fixed it by putting a Windows version check around the call to UXTheme.  If anyone else has a more elegant solution I'd love to hear it too.",
