      "Message": "I've spent a bit of time on this today morning only to find that there is a different order of windows messages in our two samples. I've attached the logs of what is sent after pressing Maximize so you can compare it yourself. In case of the Demo project the border is actually painted twice and second time the buttons are in correct state. In your CustomCaption project the border is painted only once before the button state is adjusted for new WindowState. So now I need to figure out where to put the logic to update the button states before this first painting.",
