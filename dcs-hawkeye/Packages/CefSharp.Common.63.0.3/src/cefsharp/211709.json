If you cover the form with another window and then pop it back up it does redraw the client area OK.  But it doesn't do this on a resize.  If you have child controls that are docked to fill the whole form you don't see the problem but otherwise you do.\r\n\r\nI'd like to use this code in a current project but I need a solution to this problem.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMark",
