Till now it was hosted on ProjectDistributor but as I feel need for additional tools like source control and issue tracker I decided to move it to CodePlex. <br /><br />Today I've managed to migrate the current release, sources and portions from the original articles. I've also entered some issues that ware posted on the comments. However, because starting today I'm going for two weeks vacations and won't be able to complete this before I return. <br /><br />In the meantime I encourage you to try out the current release and submit any issues and suggestions. Also please contact me if you like to join me in this project.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Szymon<br />",
