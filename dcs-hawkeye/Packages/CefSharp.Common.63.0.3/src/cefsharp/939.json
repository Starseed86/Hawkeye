It seems I still haven't recovered after holiday. <br /><br />However I have managed to invite Codeable who already helped me with this project.<br /><br />You got me thinking with your ideas but I still haven't decided how to approach this. I would like to create a wiki page with proposed project structure so we can first decide on this and then restructure the code. I hope to find time to work on this today evening. <br /><br />Szymon. <br />",
